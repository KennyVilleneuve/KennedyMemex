Befoore the passage of the law, there was no regulation on the Canadian internet, aside from Laissez-Faire capitalism.

The State owned company held a monopoly on providing internet services in Germany as it owned nearly all of the  phychical infrastructre that allowed Germans to connected to world wide web.

In the debate, Senators voice their opnions on the topic, particulary when it comes to Canadian Content. Largely the debate comes down to the question of whether or not the positive effects of prioritizing Canadian content outweigh to poetential negatives, mainly the potenttial slipperly slope that this legislation could create.  This debate is exemplified by the Hon. Senator Pierre J Dalphond's Argument that The legislation will help promote French Language content Canada-wide, and increase the penitration of Languages other than English in Canada, and the Hon.

Miligan found that there where two main arguments at the time, one by who he call the Techno-utopians, whose argument hinged on the belife that the Internet ought to regulate itslef, as technology was the key to socital progress. Within the catagory of techno-utopians where large corparations and elements of what would become the new right. On the other side of the fence where Canadians who where in favour of regulation, yet they where outnumberd, and ultimatly the internet in Canada would go on to remain fairly unregulated. Although at the same time as this was going the prsent day regulations came into effect with the main goal being to protect children. </p> <p>As in the era of the early internet the debate rages today as to weather or not regulation of the Internet is needed, escpially considering the fact that the internet of today is unimagible larger.
